### 1. Madlibs

One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on python projects for students is working on Mad Libs Generator. This is the perfect project for beginners who are just starting out with software development. Primarily focused on strings, variables, and concatenation, this project will teach you how to manipulate user-inputted data. The program design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib

### 2. Guess Number
This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
We again use the random function here. You make a move first and then the program makes one. To indicate the move, you can either use a single alphabet or input an entire string. A function will have to be set up to check the validity of the move.

### 4. TicTacToe
Tic-tac-toe is a very popular game, so let’s implement an automatic Tic-tac-toe game using Python.

The game is automatically played by the program and hence, no user input is needed. Still, developing a automatic game will be lots of fun. Let’s see how to do this.

numpy and random Python libraries are used to build this game. Instead of asking the user to put a mark on the board, code randomly chooses a place on the board and put the mark. It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins. If the game gets draw, then it returns -1.
